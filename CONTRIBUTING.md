# Contributing

You will find here the conventions and rules to request changes, submit new blog post proposals and to request new blog features and enhancements.

Please,
- [open an issue](https://github.com/src-d/blog/issues) to request any new feature or to report a bug.
- [create a new PR](https://github.com/src-d/blog/pulls) to request the review of a new post or feature.


## Propose a new blog post

The first step on the process to release a blog post is to reach general agreement on whether the topic
and general structure of the blog post makes sense. This will help you structure your blog post early and
avoid wasting any time by receiving feedback too late.

We use a very similar approach to [src-d/conferences](https://github.com/src-d/conferences), using issues
and PRs as a way to track and approve proposals.

Whenever you have a new idea for a blog post simply create a new issue following the
[post issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/post.md), you can also simply click
[here](https://github.com/src-d/blog/issues/new?template=post.md).

Once you've created this issue make sure to add the `post` label and assign it to `@vcoisne`,
he will then review the proposal and give feedback on it until the initial proposal is accepted.
Once the proposal has been accepted, the issue will be labeled with an `accepted` label, or if it's
been rejected or abandoned the issue will be closed.

## Publishing and promoting a blog post

Once accepted, follow these steps:

1. Create a copy of this [gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BxhHlkxytm-xCDVy4vRkdyjqwe9w7pIWoauaLpMMreE/edit#) in the “Blog posts” gdoc folder under DevRel & update the template header
2. Add the draft of your blog post directly in gdoc with grammarly enabled
3. Paste the draft link in the issue containing your proposal in order to let other people participate in the review process.
4. Get reviewers to add LGTM as a comment in the draft
5. Submit to DevRel for final review & scheduling

Once the post has been scheduled we use [buffer](https://bufferapp.com) to schedule posts on
Twitter and Linkedin, as well as [Later for Reddit](https://laterforreddit.com/) to post on
Reddit. Once the posts have been published we will use the #industry-news channel on our
Slack to let all employees know about the posts.

You're always welcome to provide the wording for the social media posts, as well as possible
hashtags and subreddits where you'd like the blog post to appear.

Simply include these in the issue or the google doc.
