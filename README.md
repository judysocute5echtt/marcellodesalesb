# source{d} blog  [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/src-d/blog.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/src-d/blog)

### How does it work?
Simple, every time you push the new content to your repository, the HTML is generated and deployed.

You can check the deployment on: **[CircleCI source{d} blog](https://circleci.com/gh/src-d/blog)**

### Components
- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**: creates beautiful web sites from Markdown files.
- **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**: servers the HTML code generated by Hugo.
- **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)**: runs Hugo and upload the new code to `gh-pages` branch.
