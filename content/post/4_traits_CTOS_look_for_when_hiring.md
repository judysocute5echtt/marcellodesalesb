"What do you look for when hiring?" is a question I like to ask CTOs. Why? Because I'm curious about their answers, and because I really think the answers can help us become more self aware. Gary Vaynerchuk calls self awareness the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6tKf1IR5j8" target="_blank">most important attribute</a>. I agree. That's why I challenge you to take a few minutes and dig deep inside yourself as you read these.
<br><br>

## 1) Natural Curiosity
In <a href="https://scaleyourcode.com/interviews/interview/3" target="_blank">his interview</a>, Steve Corona told me that he looks for people with a natural curiosity for things.

Talk to them. Try to figure out what they're playing with. What seems to interest them, and what have they learned over the years? Perhaps even more importantly: how did they learn it? Was it from self learning? These are the hires likely to go beyond just the task at hand. They can't just stop after accomplishing the job because they have to see if it can be done in a better way or in less time.

Stay curious and don't be afraid to show this curiosity.

**Question:** What interests you? Do you know how to leverage your interests for the job you want?
<br><br>

## 2) Team player who fits in with culture
Would you hire someone if they were a programming rockstar that could accomplish anything you threw at them in very little time? Of course! You'd give them the best compensation you could to make sure they didn't leave the company. What if they bent company values? What if they couldn't work with anyone on the team and caused internal battles or other issues as a result? Florian Motlik, CTO of Codeship, thinks that there is a delicate balance, and it is very important to find it if you are in this kind of hiring situation.

Do the issues outweigh the benefits? Are you at risk of losing customers or employees because of their behavior? In <a href="https://scaleyourcode.com/interviews/interview/7" target="_blank">Florian's interview</a>, he repeatedly stressed on having open communication. This is one of the ways he deals with this situation. Have an open conversation with this hire about what you think needs to change before bringing them on the team.

**Finding team players is almost as important as skill set.** You could argue that this depends on the job. It's up to you to find this balance.

Florian mentioned the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hard-Thing-About-Things/dp/0062273205" target="_blank">The Hard Thing About Hard Things</a> by Ben Horowitz. While geared more towards CEOs, the book talks about this balance and a lot more. I've also read it and highly recommend it.

**Question:** Are you a team player? If you are, are you properly leveraging this to get the job you want?
<br><br>

## 3) Desire to win and push hard

Have you ever worked on a project and ran out of steam? We all have. The difference between pursuing or folding was either extreme self-motivation to push forward or a teammate pushing you to keep going. 

I recently had such an experience. I met this person working on a project and I truly believe he single-handedly changed the outcome of that project. I had a hundred other things going on and decided to skimp on this project, but every time we had a meeting to discuss the project, this person always brought in more than was expected. He completely changed my mindset and I decided to try new things I'd never tried before to spice up the project. It worked. I learned a lot from this experience, and also made an incredible friend. Now if I ever have a project and need someone I know without a doubt will execute and produce solid results, he is the first person on my mind.

**People notice your efforts. If they don't you're probably not where you should be.**

**Question:** Do you remember the last person that pushed you further? Thank them when you get a chance.
<br><br>

## 4) Ability to openly communicate
This is crucial, *especially* with remote teams. Otherwise it's easy to lose track of who is working on what and the wrong things get done. This is a question I really wanted to ask Florian because they have teams all over the world in different time zones. Already think its hard to manage people in the same location and not convinced about remote employees? It's worked quite well for <a href="https://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp</a> and <a href="https://codeship.com" target="_blank">Codeship</a>. Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of Basecamp even wrote a book about it called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501?tag=viglink124722-20" target="_blank">Remote: Office Not Required</a>.

Open communication isn't just for remote teams, though. I personally grow from open communication and believe teams do as well. Whether with ScaleYourCode or anything else, if there are members on my team afraid to challenge me or openly share their thoughts, there's a problem. We all make mistakes, and we need to be held accountable for them. 

Open communication is so important for CTOs. How else are they going to get you the tools you need? How else are they going to help their teams change the world?

**Questions:** Are you always openly communicating with your CTO and team members? If not, are your fears for not doing so well grounded?

## Bonus: Do you need a college degree?
Would you hire someone without a college degree? Why?

If you don't have a degree, do you feel hampered by your lack of degree?
