This post is part of a series of posts on the past and [future](../sourced_future/) of source{d}. 

Since we started in March 2015 we’ve been working with ~250 CTOs & engineering leads 
to help them find the right developers for their teams. We started with a mission to 
"fix developer recruitment" and decided to do things differently than others:

1. We focused on building an understanding of developers based on their open-source 
& publicly available code.
2. We built an incredible team of former software engineers and computer science 
graduates to interview developers and work with our clients. Along the way we held 
back and forth email conversations with over 60,000 developers and spoke to thousands 
via Skype about what could be their next project & team to join.
3. When automatically reaching out to developers we focused on writing the best 
possible emails (often quite long ones) that explained the company, the team and 
the technical challenges they were facing, and with a handful of exceptions, always 
mentioning the name of the company and the salary (one of our frustrations with the 
status quo is that many people don’t do this).

In the beginning our analysis of developers wasn’t very good yet, we mismatched 
identities of developers (a tricky problem since people change the email address 
they use in git over time), we reached out to developers with positions to which 
they were obviously not a fit, or we reached a developer with a position that 
would have been great for them 3 years ago but not anymore today (I would like to 
give a big thank you to everyone who gave us invaluable feedback when we messed up, 
this is how we continued to improve and learn). However over the course of time, 
we kept on getting better and receiving more positive feedback from developers.

But there was one thing that started bothering us about our approach, we were 
sending automatic emails to people who didn’t opt-in. Even though we aimed to be 
highly relevant, sent small sets of emails and received overwhelmingly positive 
responses (and also the occasional negative ones), there were people who weren’t 
replying to our emails and considered us, “yet another automated email” in their 
inbox. This was a controversial topic for us, on one hand we were helping developers 
find great teams to join, and we did this with a lot of care, always putting the 
individual developer first (from day one in our company we had a saying “developers 
first, customers second”) but on the other hand it just didn’t feel right, so we 
decided to stop.

There are a lot of companies and startups that are trying to tackle the problem of “tech recruitment” 
and almost every company in this space treats the problem as one-directional. They are trying to 
optimize a utility function for the company and not for the developer themselves. And while 
“to find the best developer for a company” and “to find the best company for a developer” might 
sound symmetrical, in many cases they are not. For most companies, the best possible developer to 
hire is someone who helps deliver the maximum utility for their goals in relation to cost. 
While for the developer it’s usually about maximising a combination of their own personal learning, 
the enjoyment in their work and compensation. 

In the coming months we’ll be working on helping every developer who is in a process with our 
clients to go through it but we are stopping to take on new clients and won’t be reaching out 
to new developers anymore. While we’ve had success, we believe to be really making a difference 
in the lives of developers around the world, we should be focusing on the core-technology of 
understanding their source code. Read more about this [here](../sourced_future/).s
