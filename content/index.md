**autohugo** is a *tool* for build auto-deployable static websites.


### How works?
Simple, every time you push the new content to your repository, the HTML is generated and deployed

### Components
- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**: creates beautiful web sites from Markdown files.
- **[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**: servers the HTML code generated by Hugo.
- **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)**: runs Hugo and upload the new code to `gh-pages` branch.
